To reach my house from Schiphol, you catch a train to Amsterdam Lelylaan (7 mins) and take tram 17 (direction Centraal Station) to tramstop 'Witte de Withstraat' (6 mins). From the tramstop, it's a 5 min walk to my house. If you're travelling by car, there's usually plenty of space to park in front of or nearby the house. There's paid parking (2,40/hour) from Monday til Saturday 09h-24h. You can reach the city center (f.e. Dam Square) by foot in about 30 minutes. If you'd rather explore the city the way the locals do -by bike!- there's several bike rental shops closeby.",
